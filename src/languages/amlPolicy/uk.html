</p>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<p>
  This document provides partners, clients, vendors, contractors, employees,
  regulators, law enforcement, and other stakeholders with an overview of
  Nefentus’s AML/CTF compliance regime. It does not constitute a comprehensive
  list of all policies, procedures, and controls the Company employs to prevent
  money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities.
</p>

<h4>Definition of Money Laundering</h4>

<p>Money laundering includes:</p>

<p>
  Conversion or Transfer of Property: Transferring property derived from
  criminal activity to conceal its illicit origin or assist someone in evading
  legal consequences.<br />
  Concealment or Disguise: Hiding the true nature, source, location,
  disposition, movement, ownership, or rights of property derived from criminal
  activity.<br />
  Acquisition, Possession, or Use: Acquiring, possessing, or using property
  knowing it is derived from criminal activity.<br />
  Participation and Facilitation: Aiding, abetting, facilitating, or counseling
  the commission of any of the above actions.<br />
  Definition of Terrorist Financing<br />
  Terrorist financing involves providing or collecting funds, directly or
  indirectly, with the intent or knowledge that they will be used to carry out
  offenses outlined in Articles 1 to 4 of Council Framework Decision
  2002/475/JHA. The primary objective of terrorist activity is to intimidate a
  population or compel a government through actions such as killing, harming, or
  endangering individuals, causing significant property damage, or disrupting
  essential services.
</p>

<p>
  Risk-Based Approach and Risk Assessment<br />
  Nefentus conducts risk-based due diligence, collecting information and
  documentation on each prospective client to assess their risk profile.
  Employees exercise due diligence and good judgment to understand the overall
  character and nature of clients. The Company adheres to high ethical standards
  and avoids business relationships that could harm its reputation or compromise
  the virtual currency industry.
</p>

<p>Risk assessment categories include:</p>

<p>
  Customer risk<br />
  Geographical risk<br />
  Product risk<br />
  Delivery channel risk<br />
  Client risk profiles are periodically reviewed based on ongoing knowledge and
  activities.
</p>

<h4>Rules of Procedure and Internal Control</h4>

<p>
  Nefentus has established procedures to mitigate and manage money laundering
  and terrorism financing risks identified in its risk assessments. Employees
  must adhere to these procedures, which include:
</p>

<p>
  Due diligence measures for customers, including simplified and enhanced due
  diligence.<br />
  Risk management models and customer risk profiling.<br />
  Reporting methodologies for suspicious transactions.<br />
  Data retention and accessibility procedures.<br />
  Identifying politically exposed persons (PEPs) and those subject to
  international sanctions.<br />
  Due Diligence Measures<br />
  Simplified Due Diligence (SDD): Applied when a risk assessment indicates
  lower-than-usual risk. SDD measures ensure sufficient monitoring of
  transactions to identify unusual activities and report suspicious
  transactions.
</p>

<h4>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): </h4>
<p>
  Applied in high-risk situations, such as doubts about submitted information,
  dealings with PEPs, or clients from high-risk countries. EDD measures ensure
  adequate risk management and mitigation.
</p>

<p>PEP Definition and Screening</p>

<p>
  PEPs, their families, and close associates undergo enhanced scrutiny to
  prevent abuse of public office for private gain. PEPs include:
</p>

<p>
  Heads of state or government<br />
  Ministers and deputy ministers<br />
  Members of parliament or similar legislative bodies<br />
  High-ranking military officers<br />
  Senior officials in state-owned enterprises<br />
  Senior executives of international organizations<br />

  Matches are escalated to the Compliance Officer for further action.

  The Company promptly reports any suspicious activities related to money
  laundering, terrorism financing, or other criminal offenses to the FIUE.
  Employees and directors are prohibited from informing individuals about such
  reports or related investigations.
</p>

<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>
  Nefentus retains identification and verification documents for at least five
  years after the termination of a business relationship. Personal data is
  processed solely to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and is
  protected against misuse.

  through a comprehensive training program.<br />
