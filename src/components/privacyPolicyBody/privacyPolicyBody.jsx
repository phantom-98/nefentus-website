            <p>
              Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
              'controller' in the GDPR) The data processing controller on this
              website is: <br />
              Nefentus Solutions LTD <br />

            </p>
            <p>
              The controller is the natural person or legal entity that

              assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to
              data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other
              legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g.
              tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the
              deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

            <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA</h3>
            <p>
              Our website uses, in particular, tools from companies based in the
              USA. When these tools are active, your personal information may be
              transferred to the US servers of these companies. We must point
              out that the USA is not a safe third country within the meaning of
              EU data protection law. US companies are required to release
              personal data to security authorities without you as the data
              subject being able to take legal action against this. The
              possibility cannot therefore be excluded that US authorities (e.g.
              secret services) may process, evaluate and permanently store your
              data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence
              over these processing activities.

              subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time
              any consent you have already given us. This shall be without
              prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred
              prior to your revocation.

            <p>
              In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled
              to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the

              fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a
              commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the
              direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be
              done only if it is technically feasible.
            </p>

              confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you
              submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an
              SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted
              connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
              switches from 'http://' to 'https://' and also by the appearance
              of the lock icon in the browser line.If the SSL or TLS encryption
              is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third
              parties.

            <p>
              If you are under an obligation to share your payment information
              (e.g. account number if you give us the authority to debit your
              bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based
              contract with us, this information is required to process
              payments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment transactions using common modes of paying
              (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed
              exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can
              recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address
              line of the browser switches from 'http://' to 'https://' and also
              by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
            </p>
            <p>

              of this data.

            <p>
              If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR,

              processing of your personal data.

              entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
              legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by

              Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as
              'cookies.' Cookies are small text files that do not cause any
              damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the
              duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently
              archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are
              automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent
              cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete
              them or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

              In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored
              on your device once you enter our site (third-party cookies).
              These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain

              Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
              essential since certain website functions would not work in the
              absence of the cookies (e.g. the shopping cart function or the
              display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the
              analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.

              of certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g. for
              the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
              optimization of the website (e.g. cookies that provide measurable
              insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of

              Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the
              behavior patterns of website visitors. To that end, the website
              operator receives a variety of user data, such as pages accessed,

            <h4>Google Ads</h4>
            <p>
              The website operator uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online
              promotional program of Google Ireland Limited ('Google'), Gordon
              House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google Ads enables us to display ads in the Google search engine
              or on third-party websites, if the user enters certain search
              terms into Google (keyword targeting). It is also possible to
              place targeted ads based on the user data Google has in its
              possession (e.g. location data and interests; target group
              targeting). As the website operator, we can analyze these data
              quantitatively, for instance by analyzing which search terms
              resulted in the display of our ads and how many ads led to
              respective clicks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of Google Ads is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. et seq.
              GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in marketing
              the operator's services and products as effectively as possible.

              The provider of these solutions is Google Ireland Limited
              ('Google'), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google Remarketing analyzes your user patterns on our website
              (e.g. clicks on specific products), to allocate a certain
              advertising target groups to you and to subsequently display
              matching online offers to you when you visit other online offers
              (remarketing or retargeting).
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, it is possible to link the advertising target groups
              generated with Google Remarketing to device encompassing functions
              of Google. This makes it possible to display interest-based
              customized advertising messages, depending on your prior usage and
              browsing patterns on a device (e.g. cell phone) in a manner
              tailored to you as well as on any of your devices (e.g. tablet or
              PC).

              GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the
              marketing of the operator's products that is as effective as
              possible. If a respective declaration of consent was requested,
              processing shall occur exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1
              lit. a GDPR; the given consent may be revoked at any time.

              many users have clicked on our ads and which actions they have
              completed. We do not receive any information that would allow us
              to personally identify the users. Google as such uses cookies or

              transmitted to a Microsoft Clarity server (possibly in the USA)
              and stored in order to enable session recording and to generate
              so-called heat maps. We use Microsoft Clarity in the default
              settings, so that the data transmitted to Microsoft does not
              contain any sensitive input data such as names or addresses, to
              rule out any direct personal reference. Microsoft will use this

            <h4>Facebook Pixel</h4>
            <p>
              To measure conversion rates, this website uses the visitor
              activity pixel of Facebook. The provider of this service is
              Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.
              According to Facebook's statement the collected data will be
              transferred to the USA and other third-party countries too.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tool allows the tracking of page visitors after they have
              been linked to the website of the provider after clicking on a
              Facebook ad. This makes it possible to analyze the effectiveness
              of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes and
              to optimize future advertising campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              For us as the operators of this website, the collected data is
              anonymous. We are not in a position to arrive at any conclusions
              as to the identity of users. However, Facebook archives the
              information and processes it, so that it is possible to make a
              connection to the respective user profile and Facebook is in a
              position to use the data for its own promotional purposes in
              compliance with the Facebook Data Usage Policy. This enables
              Facebook to display ads on Facebook pages as well as in locations
              outside of Facebook. We as the operator of this website have no
              control over the use of such data.
            </p>

            <p>
              The use of Facebook Pixel is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR.
              The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in effective
              advertising campaigns, which also include social media. If a
              corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to
              the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on
              the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be
              revoked at any time.

            <h4>Google reCaptcha v3</h4>
            <p>
              We use the open source technology reCaptcha v3 from Google Ireland
              Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04
              E5W5, Ireland on our website. This service helps our website to
              prevent spam and block bots. The program recognizes whether the
              user is a real person or a bot in order to protect our website
              from cyber attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              ReCaptcha v3 works with an algorithm that collects and analyzes a
              user's interactions with a website to create a score. The final
              score indicates whether the activity is suspicious. This version
              aims to improve the user experience by eliminating the need for
              questions and creating a seamless user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following data is processed by reCaptcha: Mouse and keyboard
              behavior (every action you perform with the mouse or keyboard),
              information about your operating system, date and language
              settings of your browser, the Google cookies placed on the
              website, your answers to the question fields on the website,
              referrer URL (via which website/advertising media you came to this
              website), CSS information, all JavaScript objects, screen
              resolution and the plug-ins installed in your browser. The
              algorithm also recognizes IP addresses that were previously
              recognized as human by cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the
              fulfillment of our legal obligation regarding the obtaining of
              consent and its verifiability in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1
              lit. a GDPR. In addition, there is a legitimate interest in the
              use of Google reCaptcha to optimize and increase the security of
              the online offer, the legal basis for which is Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
              f GDPR. Further information on the data processed through the use
              of reCaptcha v3 can be found in the privacy policy at: https:

            <h3>
              7. Online-based Audio and Video Conferences (Conference tools)
            </h3>
            <h4>Data processing</h4>
            <p>
              We use online conference tools, among other things, for
              communication with our customers. The tools we use are listed in
              detail below. If you communicate with us by video or audio
              conference using the Internet, your personal data will be
              collected and processed by the provider of the respective
              conference tool and by us. The conferencing tools collect all
              information that you provide/access to use the tools (email
              address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference
              tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time)
              of participation in the conference, number of participants and
              other 'context information' related to the communication process
              (metadata).
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical
              data required for the processing of the online communication. This
              includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
              device type, operating system type and version, client version,
              camera type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should content be exchanged, uploaded or otherwise made available
              within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
              provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
              recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
              videos, files, whiteboards and other information shared while
              using the service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
              processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are
              largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective
              provider. Further information on data processing by the conference
              tools can be found in the data protection declarations of the
              tools used, and which we have listed below this text.
            </p>

            <h4>Purpose and legal bases</h4>

            <p>
              The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or
              existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
              customers (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR). Furthermore,
              the use of the tools serves to generally simplify and accelerate
              communication with us or our company (legitimate interest in the
              meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Insofar as consent has
              been requested, the tools in question will be used on the basis of
              this consent; the consent may be revoked at any time with effect
              from that date.
            </p>

            <h4>Duration of storage</h4>

            <p>
              Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools
              will be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us
              to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for
              storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your
              end device until you delete them. Mandatory legal retention
              periods remain unaffected.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that
              is stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own
              purposes. For details, please contact directly the operators of
              the conference tools.
