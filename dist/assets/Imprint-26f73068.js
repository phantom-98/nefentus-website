However, should there be problems of any kind, we would like to ask you to contact us immediately. If you suspect that this website violates any of your intellectual property rights, please notify us immediately by email so that remedial action can be taken quickly. Please note: The more time-consuming intervention of a lawyer for the fee-based warning for the service provider does not correspond to his real or presumed will. Establishing contact makes sense on both sides to avoid unnecessary litigation and unnecessary costs. We will immediately have your objection examined and immediately stop it if warranted. Without prior contact, we will reject the cost note of your legal efforts and warning in the sense of a duty of mitigation on your part as unfounded.",
